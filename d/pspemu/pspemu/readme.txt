Compiled using Digital Mars D compiler Version 2.0.
- http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/changelog.html
- Tested on version 2.039

This project started as a proof of concept of an emulator made in D 1.0.

It was initally based on the Noxa's great emulator pspplayer that was made in C#.
Specially the GPU part.

On September 2009 I moved the repository to google code.
And for December I started the emulator again from scratch using D 2.0.
The lastest old version can be accessed here:
- http://pspemu.googlecode.com/svn/branches/old/

And here the lastest new version:
- http://pspemu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

As for today I know there are two active and very promising psp emulators:
- http://www.pcsp-emu.com/
- http://www.jpcsp.org/

I plan to continue developing my emulator.
I think D is a great language for creating an emulator and any kind of application.
Like I said some time ago I don't have too much spare time, but I like toying with D and reverse enginering.
